\revadd{Notes on TBM 2 to teams/referee/organizer:\\}

\revadd{1. The cover plates are organized in the conveyor belt with the order of \textbf{unusable-unusable-faulty-faulty} (yes, specifically in this order).
The reasoning is because processing unusable cover plate is ``simpler" than processing faulty ones.
As such the only way to ensure fairness is to have a specific ordering of the cover plates.}

\revadd{2. \textbf{Each cover plates needs to be processed entirely before the robot move on to processing the next cover plate.} 
Unusable cover plate should be delivered to the trash container box and faulty cover plate should be fixed with the drilling machine. 
Please note that processing of each cover plates doesn't have to be succesful, yet the robot need to show the expected behavior to complete the process. 
This is to prevent any achievement mining (e.g. repeatedly only picking a cover plate from the conveyor belt's exit ramp).}
